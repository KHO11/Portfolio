# Portfolio

A portfolio about me and my experiences so far as a software developer. A way of making a portfolio website with more detail and better design is through a CMS in wordpress and coded with PHP.
I was focused on making the design on my portfolio to look very good and appealing so I decided to use elementor on wordpress to customize the portfolio website.
